            <h1>A Report on HTML</h1>
            <p><u>HyperText Markup Language, commonly abbreviated as HTML, is the standard markup language used to create web pages. Along with CSS, and JavaScript, HTML is a cornerstone technology used to create web pages,[1] as well as to create user interfaces for mobile and web applications. Web browsers can read HTML files and render them into visible or audible web pages. HTML describes the structure of a website semantically and, before the advent of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), included cues for the presentation or appearance of the document (web page), making it a markup language, rather than a programming language.</u></p><br />
            
            <p><i>HTML elements form the building blocks of HTML pages. HTML allows images and other objects to be embedded and it can be used to create interactive forms. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as img and input introduce content into the page directly. Others such as p surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.</i></p><br />
            
            <p><b>HTML can embed scripts written in languages such as JavaScript which affect the behavior of HTML web pages. HTML markup can also refer the browser to Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) to define the look and layout of text and other material. The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), maintainer of both the HTML and the CSS standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.</b></p><br />
            
            <h3>WYSIWYG Editors</h3>

            <p><i>There are some WYSIWYG editors (What You See Is What You Get), in which the user lays out everything as it is to appear in the HTML document using a graphical user interface (GUI), often similar to word processors. The editor renders the document rather than show the code, so authors do not require extensive knowledge of HTML.
            The WYSIWYG editing model has been criticized,primarily because of the low quality of the generated code; there are voices advocating a change to the WYSIWYM model (What You See Is What You Mean).</i></p>
            
            <p><b>WYSIWYG editors remain a controversial topic because of their perceived flaws such as:
                <ul>
                <li>Relying mainly on layout as opposed to meaning, often using markup that does not convey the intended meaning but simply copies the layout.</li>
                <li>Often producing extremely verbose and redundant code that fails to make use of the cascading nature of HTML and CSS.</li>
                <li>Often producing ungrammatical markup, called tag soup or semantically incorrect markup (such as em for italics).</li>
                <li>As a great deal of the information in HTML documents is not in the layout, the model has been criticized for its "what you see is all you get"-nature.</li>
                </ul>
